# Handwritten_Digits_Classification
Neural Network For Handwritten Digits Classification 
build my first neural network in tensorflow and python for handwritten digits classification. I first built a very simple neural network with only input and output layer. After that I added a hidden layer and checked how the performance of the model changes.
